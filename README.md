## Setup 
**Create and activate the Python environment using UV and `pyproject.toml`**:

```bash
    uv sync
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # or
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

**Important**: The data file `assignment8.dta` must be located in the same directory as the notebook file `Assignment8.ipynb`.


## Running the Analysis

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Or if you prefer Jupyter Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. **Open the notebook**: Navigate to and open `Assignment8.ipynb`.

3. **Choose the proper kernel**: In Jupyter, select the Python kernel that matches your environment.

4. **Run the analysis**: Execute the cells in order. 

## Output Files

The notebook will generate:
- `Figure1.png`: Histogram showing wage distributions by state and time period
